# OP_ROVER

## This is the main github for the Rover project.
The purpose of this project is to create an all terrain surverying robot, Used for checking out areas that could be unsafe for people to get to.

We want to be able to have it get over and around hazardous areas autonomously and map out areas using a lidar to show any risks and areas of concern.
