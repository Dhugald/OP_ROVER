# Rover Project

## This is the main github for the Rover project.
The purpose of this project is to create a self driving all terrain surverying robot, Used for checking out areas that could be unsafe for people to get to.

We want to be able to have it get over and around hazardous areas autonomously and map out areas using a lidar to show any risks and areas of concern.

# Plan
## Base plan

Drone has a 540mm x 320mm base.
Need to trim off the sides of the existing frame, maybe create a smaller box frame for the internal components?

## Wheels and legs planning
750mm length for the rocker-bogie when set-up, need to calculate the total length of parts
150mm diameter wheels (Similar to the ones used to farmbot(killbot) if possible to find).

Might need to make a 3d model of the base and the legs to get a better feel of them.

## Sensor layout
- Lidar to make a minimap to find entrys and exits.
- Lidar to spin and map a room in 3d on unity
- Camera to view through
- Sensors on all 4 sides to help with obstacle avoidance and detection

As a group we need to work out a sensor layout that we all agree on.
